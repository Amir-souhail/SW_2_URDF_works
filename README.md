# SW_2_URDF_works
A collection of SOLIDWORKS models converted to URDF format for use in robotics simulations and applications


This repository contains SOLIDWORKS models converted into **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** files.  
The goal is to make CAD designs easily usable in robotics simulations and applications such as **ROS** and **Gazebo**.

## Contents
- SOLIDWORKS source files (`.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`)
- Exported URDF files
- Associated meshes (`.STL`, `.DAE`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidworks-to-urdf.git
````

2. Open the URDF files in your preferred robotics environment (e.g., ROS, Gazebo, RViz).
3. Use the provided meshes for visualization and simulation.

## Notes

* Models are organized by project.
* Ensure correct scaling and coordinate frames when importing into your simulation environment.
