This repository showcases my first attempt at converting a SolidWorks robotic arm assembly into a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for use in ROS (Robot Operating System). The CAD parts were provided in the tutorial by [Age of Robotics](https://github.com/ageofrobotics/urdf_tutorial), and I focused on assembling them into a functional URDF model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* **Software**:

  * SolidWorks (for CAD model viewing or modification)
  * ROS (Robot Operating System)
  * SolidWorks to URDF Exporter (e.g., [sw\_urdf\_exporter](https://github.com/ros-industrial/solidworks_urdf))
* **Hardware**:

  * Optional: Robotic arm hardware for testing

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SWtoURDFproject.git
   cd SWtoURDFproject
   ```

2. **Open CAD files**:

   * Open `.SLDPRT` and `.STEP` files in SolidWorks to inspect or modify the robotic parts.

3. **Generate URDF**:

   * Use the SolidWorks to URDF Exporter to convert the assembly into a URDF model.

4. **Integrate with ROS**:

   * Place URDF and STL files in a ROS workspace.
   * Launch the visualization using the provided launch files:

     ```bash
     roslaunch sw_to_urdf_project display.launch
     ```
